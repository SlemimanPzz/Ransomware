# To build 

- Download [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) 
- Do `cargo build --release` get the executable, if you are not on a windows system add the `--target=x86_64-pc-windows-gnu` flag

> DO NOT do `cargo run`, especially on a windows system since this will encrypt all your files.
